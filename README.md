## Using Prisma ORM with MongoDB inÂ Next.js

NextJS web application that displays a search box.
Display the first 9 results in a 3 x 3 grid below the search box. 
For each product, display the image and product name and link both to the product detail page.
All search queries should be persisted so that the search history is still available across application restarts.
API endpoint that allows you to retrieve the search history in JSON format.
The application should be "polished" and include suitable testing, documentation and support for various screen sizes.
